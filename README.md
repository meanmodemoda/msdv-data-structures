# Introduction
This is an ongoing documentation of my course progress of Data Structures taken during my study at Parsons' Data Visualization MS porgram in Fall 2021.

## Current Progress

**Week 1** - Use Node.js `got` method to extract html body content of 10 Manhattan AA meeting links and save them into text files. Create a loop to loop through the urls and save the text files accordingly. 

**Week 2** - Use `ceerio` to extract and save content. Observe the HTML element structure in one of the AA text files, use appropriate selectors to extract address content. Use various string methods to clean up content and save to a JSON file. 

**Week 3** - Use API to extract additional data using existing data as query component. Write data into a composite array structure and save to a JSON file. 

**Week 4** - Learn and design a SQL database schema. 

**Week 5** - Design a NoSQL data model that converts [this running list of fashion investments](https://thefashionlaw.com/a-running-timeline-of-fashion-and-luxury-mergers-acquisitions/) into a more reader-friendly format with the ability to search, filter and aggregate.
